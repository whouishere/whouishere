### Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm Willian, a self-taught student that is still focusing on learning new stuff!

I'm somewhat fluent in Java, C/C++ and Python.

At the moment, learning OpenGL, Flask, Go, Rust and Julia.

I'd say my focus was always more on the game development side, since I'm gaming as early as I can remember, and I love creating fun experiences!

Another big interest of mine is the free software movement. Everything I do is probably gonna be free software, and I look forward to a future where free software is the norm.

Though I don't have any projects finished __yet__, I am working on those, even if at snail speed.

For example, I'm currently working on:
- A ToDo list app on Flask
- My own games on the libGDX framework
- Simple Minecraft clone in OpenGL
- Weather web app on Flask
