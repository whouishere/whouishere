### Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm Willian, a self-taught student that is still focusing on learning new stuff!

I'm fluent in C/C++, Go and Python.

At the moment, learning OpenGL, Rust and Julia.

I'd say my focus was always more on the game development side, since I'm gaming as early as I can remember, and I love creating fun experiences!

Another big interest of mine is the free software movement. Everything I do is probably gonna be free software, and I look forward to a future where free software is the norm.

Though I don't have any projects finished __yet__, I am working on those, even if at snail speed.

For example, I'm currently working on:
- Small games on Godot, libGDX and raylib
- Simple OpenGL [Minecraft clone/engine](https://gitlab.com/whouishere/cubesnstuff) in modern C++
